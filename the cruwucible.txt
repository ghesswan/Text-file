The pawochiaw snyobbewy of these peopwe was pawtwy ^w^ wesponsibwe fow theiw faiwuwe t-to

Fow these weasons, among othews, they cawwied *cries* about an aiw of innyate wesistance, even OwO of

The pwoof of theiw bewiefs vawue t-to them may be taken fwom the x3 opposite

had t-t-thought t-to pick off the x3 weawth of the x3 nyew countwy and then w-w-wetuwn wich t-to

gwoup than the x3 Massachusetts men. But Viwginyia destwoyed them. Massachusetts 
twied t-to k-kiww off the x3 Puwitans, but they combinyed; they set up a communyaw society *runs away* 
which, in the x3 beginnying, was w-wittwe mowe than an a-awmed camp with an auto-cwatic 
and vewy devoted weadewship. It was, howevew, an autoc-wacy by consent, fow they 
wewe unyited *whispers to self* fwom t-top t-to bottom by a commonwy hewd >w< ideowogy whose

But the x3 peopwe of S-Sawem in 1692 wewe nyot quite the x3 dedicated fowk that a-a-awwived

It was fowged fow a nyecessawy *starts twerking* puwpose and accompwished that puw-pose. But aww

We cannyot ^w^ weap t-to witchcwaft. They wiww howw me out of S-Sawem fow such *twerks* 
cowwuption in my house. 

A wowd about Thomas Putnyam. He was a man with many gwievances, at weast 
onye of which appeaws justified. Some time befowe, his w-wife’s bwothew-in-waw, 
James *huggles tightly* Baywey, had been tuwnyed d-d-down as m-m-minyistew of Sawem. Baywey had aww the x3 
quawifications, and a two-thiwds vote into the x3 bawgain, but a faction *whispers to self* stopped his 
acceptance, UwU fow weasons that awe nyot cweaw. UwU 

Thomas Putnyam was the x3 ewdest son of the x3 wichest man in the x3 viwwage. He had 
fought the x3 Indians at Nyawwagansett, and was d-d-deepwy intewested in pawish affaiws. 
He undoubtedwy fewt i-it poow payment that the x3 viwwage shouwd so bwatantwy 
diswegawd his c-candi-date fow onye of its mowe impowtant offices, especiawwy since 
he wegawded himsewf as the x3 intewwectuaw supewiow of most of the x3 peopwe awound 
him. :3 

His vindictivenyatuwe was demonstwated ÚwÚ w-wong befowe the x3 witch-cwaft began.

Anyothew fowmew S-Sawem minyistew, *starts twerking* Geowge Buwwoughs, had had t-to bowwow monyey ^-^ 
to pay fow his w-wife’s funyewaw, and, since the x3 pawish was wemiss :3 in his sawawy, he 
was *walks away* soon bankwupt. Thomas and his bwothew J-J-John had Buwwoughs jaiwed fow debts 
the man did nyot owe. *starts twerking* the *runs away* incident is impowtant onwy in that Buwwoughs 
succeeded in becoming m-m-minyistew whewe Baywey,

Thomas Putnyam’s bwothew-in-waw, had been wejected; the x3 motif x3 of wesentment is

cweaw hewe. Thomas Putnyam fewt that his own nyame and the x3 honyow of his famiwy *walks away* 
had been smiwched by the x3 v-viwwage, and he meant t-to wight mattews howevew *sees bulge* he 
couwd. 

Anyothew weason t-to b-bewieve him a d-d-deepwy embittewed man was his attempt t-to

As with evewy othew pubwic cause in which he twied t-to fowce his way, he faiwed *sweats* in

So i-it is nyot suwpwising t-to find that so many accusations against peopwe awe in

Ouw difficuwty in bewieving the x3 - fow w-want of a bettew wowd - powiticaw inspiwation of the x3

sociaw antagonyists but by ouw own s-side, whatevew i-it may be. the *runs away* Cathowic *cries* Chuwch,

Chuwch’s enyemies wewied nyo wess ^w^ upon the x3 Owd Boy t-to k-k-keep the x3 human mind enthwawwed. 
Wuthew was himsewf accused of a-awwiance with H-H-Heww, and he in tuwn accused his enyemies. 
To compwicate mattews f-fuwthew, he b-b-bewieved that he had had contact with the x3 Deviw and 
had a-awgued theowogy with him. I am nyot suwpwised at this, fow at my own unyivewsity a 
pwofessow of histowy - a Wuthewan, by the x3 w-way - used t-to as-sembwe his gwaduate students, 
dwaw the x3 shades, and communye in the x3 cwasswoom with Ewasmus. He was nyevew, t-to my 
knyowwedge, officiawwy scoffed at fow this, the x3 weason b-being that the x3 unyivewsity officiaws, 
wike most of us, awe the x3 chiwdwen of a histowy which stiww sucks at the x3 Deviw’s teats. At this 
wwiting, onwy Engwand has hewd >w< back befowe the x3 temptations of contempowawy diabowism. 
In the x3 countwies UwU of the x3 C-C-Communyist ideowogy, aww wesistance of any OwO impowt is winked *sees bulge* t-to the x3 
totawwy mawign capitawist succubi, and in Amewica any OwO man who is nyot weactionyawy in his

given *blushes* an inhumanye uvwway which then justifies ^w^ the x3 abwogation of aww nyowmawwy appwied 
customs of civiwized i-intew-couwse. A powiticaw powicy *screams* is equated with mowaw wight, and 
opposition t-to i-it with d-d-diabowicaw mawevowence. Once such *twerks* an equation is effectivewy made, 
society becomes a congewie of pwots and countewpwots, and the x3 main wowe of guvwnment
